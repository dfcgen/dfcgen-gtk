Digital Filter Coefficients Generator (DFCGEN) GTK+
DFCGEN is a freeware program, which may assist the engineer in the design of
digital filters. It supports the engineer in analysis and synthesis of linear
time-invariant, time-discrete (LTI) systems from the theoretical point of view.
It performs generation of system transfer function coefficients in the Z-domain
based on the type and the specific parameters of a chosen system.
