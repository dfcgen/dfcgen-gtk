This directory tree holds the version 0.5 source code of DFCGen GTK+,
the Digital Filter Coefficients Generator for GTK+.


Features
========

DFCGen, assists the engineer in design of digital filters.  It supports the
engineer in analysis and synthesis of linear time-invariant time-discrete
(LTI) systems from the theoretical point of view.  It performs generation of
system transfer unction coefficients in the Z-domain, based on the type and
specific parameters of a chosen system.

DFCGen supports:

* Linear FIR systems of various characteristics with windowing functions as
  Hamming, van Hann, Blackman or Kaiser window

* Standard IIR filters like Cauer, Chebyshev, Butterworth and Bessel

* Various systems of free degree as e.g. Integrator, Hilbert transformer,
  Comb filter etc.

* Predefined systems with determined coefficients (and degree) as fitting
  filters, differentiators

* Frequency transformation into high-pass, band-pass and band-stop

* Edit of coefficients (change, delete, round)

* Pole/Zero analysis

* Graphical visualisation of system characteristics (plots) as magnitude
  response, phase response, attenuation, characteristic function, group delay,
  phase delay, impulse response and step response

* In plots: zoom, lin./log. and auto-scaling

* Printing of coefficients and response plots

* Save and load of the defined filter

* Export of coefficients to plain text, "C" language and MATLAB scripts


Maintainer Make
===============

Beside of mentioned `make' targets in file INSTALL, there are some additional
maintainer make targets:

* `make dist' in root directory generates a distribution package

* `make dist-debian' in root directory builds a Debian package

* `make dist-win32' in root directory builds (on MinGW) a Win32 package

* `make distcheck' in root directory checks the package for distribution (and
  updates the `gettext' database and `po' files)

* `make maintainer-clean' in root directory deletes all object files,
  the executable and all distribution files that can be regenerated by
  Automake/Autoconf

* `make dox' in root directory generates the `Doxygen' source code
  documentation

* `make update-po' in `po' directory updates the strings list in file `de.po'

* `make all' in `po' directory builds the `gmo' file(s)
