What is dfcgen-gtk?

    DFCGEN, the Digital Filter Coefficients Generator, is a FREEWARE
    tool/program, which may assist you in the design of digital filters. It
    supports the engineer in analysis and synthesis of linear time-invariant
    time-discrete (LTI) systems from the theoretical point of view.  It
    performs generation of system transfer function coefficients in the Z-domain
    based on the type and the specific parameters of a chosen system.

    It supports:

    * Linear FIR systems of various characteristics with windowing functions as
      Hamming, Hanning, Blackman or Kaiser window

    * Standard IIR filters like Cauer, Chebyshev, Butterworth and Bessel

    * Various systems of free degree as e.g. Integrator, Hilbert transformer,
      Comb filter etc.

    * Predefined systems with determined coefficients (and degree) as fitting
      filters, differentiators

    * Frequency transformation into high-pass, band-pass and band-stop

    * Edit of coefficients (change, delete, round)

    * Pole/Zero analysis

    * Graphical visualisation of system characteristics (plots) as magnitude
      response, phase response, attenuation, characteristic function, group delay,
      phase delay, impulse response and step response

    * In plots: zoom, lin./log. and auto-scaling

    * Save and load of the defined filter



What do I need to run dfcgen-gtk?

    A Unix-like system (including Windows with cygwin) with the following
    libraries installed:
    * GNU Scientific Library (GSL) 1.6 or higher (libgsl)
    * GIMP Toolkit 2 (GTK+) 2.8 (with printing support 2.10) or higher



What do I need to compile dfcgen-gtk?

    You need the standard development tools for C/C++, e.g.
    * compiler (gcc, g++, cpp)
    * autotools (autoconf, automake, libtool)
    * make, m4
    and header files of (development) packages as
    * libstdc
    * libgsl0-dev
    * GTK+/GDK (and all dependent packages)
