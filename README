What is dfcgen-gtk?

    DFCGen, the Digital Filter Coefficients Generator, is a FREEWARE
    tool/program, which may assist you in the design of digital filters. It
    supports the engineer in analysis and synthesis of linear time-invariant
    time-discrete (LTI) systems from the theoretical point of view. It
    performs generation of system transfer function coefficients in the Z-domain,
    based on the type and specific parameters of a chosen system.

    It supports:

    * Linear FIR systems of various characteristics with windowing functions as
      Hamming, Hanning, Blackman or Kaiser window

    * Standard IIR filters like Cauer, Chebyshev, Butterworth and Bessel

    * Various systems of free degree as e.g. Integrator, Hilbert transformer,
      Comb filter etc.

    * Predefined systems with determined coefficients (and degree) as fitting
      filters, differentiators

    * Frequency transformation into high-pass, band-pass and band-stop

    * Edit of coefficients (change, delete, round)

    * Pole/Zero analysis

    * Graphical visualisation of system characteristics (plots) as magnitude
      response, phase response, attenuation, characteristic function, group delay,
      phase delay, impulse response and step response

    * In plots: zoom, lin./log. and auto-scaling

    * Printing of coefficients and response plots

    * Save and load of the defined filter

    * Export of coefficients to plain text, "C" language and MATLAB scripts
