* User Interface
The following improvements shall ensure similiar GUI features as are available
in old Win3.x version.

  - cairoPlot2d
    Make axisX.start and axisX.stop positions dependent of precision

  - createAxisLabel
    Parametrize margin by precision

  - treeSelectionCallback
    Process double-clicks (see the tree-view tutorial on how to make this)

  - responseWinCreate
    Restore size of drawing area from last session 

  - filterResponseTimeNew
    Allow user break 


* Filter Design
Improvements on algorithms currently implemented

  - linFirFilterGen
    Correct the lowpass design cutoff frequency (see Bessel lowpass) when
    performing frequency transformations (depends on characteristic too,
    significant on perfect lowpass).

  - ftrHighpass
    Handle odd degree


* Stability

  - linFirFilterGen
    Implement semantic checks on bandwidth, center and cutoff frequency

  - stdIirFilterGen
    Implement sematic checks on bandwidth, center and cutoff frequency

  - linFirFilterGen
    Use fpsetround()?

  - mathMisc.c
    Implement a generic math. error handler

  - ftrBandstop
    Handle GSL_POSINF for call to filterResponsePoly() 


* Maintainability

  - mathPolyCoeffs2Roots
    Try to avoid mixing error codes from gsl_errno.h and errno.h 

  - linFirDesignDlgApply
    Share code with IIR design dialog


* Style/Comments

  - genCosine2System
    Give formula

  - chebyT
    Improve function description by the help of LaTeX

  - timeResponseProcNext
    Describe algo used here 


* Optimization

  - mainDlgCreate
    Reduce number of variables used

  - responseWidget
    Try to move some of these data into responsePlot.c


* Testing

  - plotPhase
    Check phase response of linear FIR filters and improve the graph layout


* New Features

  - New filter class ARBITRARY
    Support of arbitrary frequency specification by Parks-McClellan algorithm

  - Printing
    Print support (requires GTK 2.10)

  - Export
    More export formats for filter coefficients and plots


  - Response Plot
    Display coordinate when mouse moves over graph area
