Description: Digital Filter Coefficients Generator (DFCGen) GTK+
 DFCGen, the Digital Filter Coefficients Generator, assists the engineer
 in the design of digital filters. It supports the engineer in analysis
 and synthesis of linear time-invariant time-discrete (LTI) systems from
 the theoretical point of view. It performs generation of system transfer
 function coefficients in the Z-domain, based on the type and specific
 parameters of a chosen system.
