Description: Digital Filter Coefficients Generator (DFCGEN) GTK+
    DFCGEN, the Digital Filter Coefficients Generator, is a free program,
    which assists the engineer in the design of digital filters. It supports
    the engineer in analysis and synthesis of linear time-invariant
    time-discrete (LTI) systems from the theoretical point of view. It performs
    generation of system transfer function coefficients in the Z-domain, based
    on the type and specific parameters of a chosen system.
