Description: Digital Filter Coefficients Generator (DFCGEN) GTK+
    DFCGEN, the Digital Filter Coefficients Generator, is a freeware
    program, which assists the engineer in the design of digital filters.
    It supports the engineer in analysis and synthesis of linear time-invariant
    time-discrete (LTI) systems from the theoretical point of view. It
    performs generation of system transfer function coefficients in the Z-domain
    based on the type and the specific parameters of a chosen system.
