What's new in version 0.1?
----------------------------

All and nothing. 'dfcgen-gtk' is a GTK+ port of my old Win3.X program, called
Digital Filter Coefficients Generator (DFCGEN).


Differences to DFCGEN/Win v1.x
------------------------------

* Bugfixes
  - axis label assignment does not work as expected (sometimes too less grid
    points and labels)

* Unsupported (not implemented in version 0.1)
  - numeric roots display
  - viewing mathematical functions
  - printing
  - multiple document interface (MDI)
  - command line arguments
  - online help
